# Introduction

One of the first classes I took for my Master's of Information in Cybersecurity course at UC Berkeley was Beyond the Code: Cybersecurity in Context. The course was designed to provide a broad overview of all the non-technical issues that arise in the field of cybersecurity.

For my final project I decided to focus on the intersection of cybersecurity and civil liberties, specifically focusing on freedom of association and assembly. 

The presentation was recorded and uploaded to Youtube. Feel free to watch it below
